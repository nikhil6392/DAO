# DAO

Hello I am Nikhil Pathak. Hope you are doing well.In this project I have developed a decentralized platform where
people can stake their Eth and earn exclusive roles such as Contributor and StakeHolder in the ecosytem. This DApp 
is build with solidity smart contract which ensure security and trustless interaction on the blockchain. and The 
React empowers this application with smooth and user-friendly experience.

## Objective
To create a secure decentralized platform where users can stake their Eth to earn distinct roles in the ecosytem.
This project aims to merge blockchain technology with incentive-based engagement by leveraging Solidity for robust
smart contract development and React for an intuitive user experience. 
Ultimately, the goal is to empower users as Contributors and Stakeholders in the ecosystem, providing transparency,
security, and value through decentralized finance.
